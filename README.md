Hi guys, I'm Nhân. Let me guess, you probably came from my Linktree or Firefox add-ons.

Unlike other developers and programmers, I don't wear many hats. I'm just a hobbyist in programming languages specifically and software/OS generally.

I have one and only one goal: to make projects in order to make my life (and others who use my projects) easier and less of a nuisance.

It's hard to keep track of my TODO list because it's scattered across my Google Tasks and Firefox add-ons, so I decided to centralize and put it on [GitHub](https://github.com/nhantrichuyenanh/TODO).
