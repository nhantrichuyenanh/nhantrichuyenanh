Hi guys, I'm Nhân. Let me guess, you probably came from my Linktree or Firefox add-ons.

Unlike other developers and programmers, I don't wear many hats. I'm just a hobbyist in programming languages specifically and software/OS generally.

I have one and only one goal: to make projects in order to make my life (and others who use my projects) easier and less of a nuisance.

Hosting my own website/blog requires technical maintenance, financial overhead and I need a platform to host my knowledge base that I can revisit easily, so I've chosen GitHub.
